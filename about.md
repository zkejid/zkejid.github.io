# About

My name is Ivan, I started this blog for myself at the fist place. I belive it can help manage my ideas and turn them into something real. I'm software engineer. Ability to create something new and amazing always inspired me. But there were only ideas and dreams for a long time. I was stuck with my routine life. So I state the goal of this blog: *to take a place for not only dreams but also deeds*.

And though I started this blog for myself, I'm glad to see you here. Welcome! Here is [my first post](/2020/01/14/welcome.html). Also feel free to explore other stuff here.
