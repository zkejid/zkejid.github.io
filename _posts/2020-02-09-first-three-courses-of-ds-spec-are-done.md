# "Three DS courses" milestone

Four days ago I've finished third course of [Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). Let me sum up my thoughts on this specialization in this post.

Here are these courses:

* [The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools?specialization=jhu-data-science). It is an intro course aiming to set up programming environment.
* [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming?specialization=jhu-data-science). Goal of this course is to give you basics of R programming.
* [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning?specialization=jhu-data-science). This course mainly about manipulating raw data to make it available for further research.

Here are some tips for those who are deciding to enroll the course or not.

_Toolbox_ course was extreamly simple for me. At the moment of enrollment I was a completly novice, so it helped me to properly install all necessary software. However it was such a waste of time. I think, the goal of course can be achived with simple installation guide. 

_R Programming_ course was much more interesting! It helped understand the idea of R language: "it is a language made by scientists for scientists". This phrase precisely describes the language, its major flaws, advantages and disadvantages. With this understanding it is much easier to handle all R's unintuitive puzzles. The major flaw of this course for me is in its inconsistency. Language basics are taugth in a mosaic way, with quizes not matching to lectures metherial. I'm going to enroll to other course later, which provides more consistent view on R language.

_Working with Data_ course was the most dificult one. The dificulty was born from unexpected freedom the course is providing. Once I realized that there is no clear instruction on how to get a result. It was disturbing moment, but there was enough tips and hints in the forum to complete the course. Have to say some words about course project. Lectures are not enough to complete it, and it takes a time to realize it. I had to read additional matherials on github provided by mentors to complete project. I think it should be stated more clear in instructions or lectures. 

So far now I'm satisfied with the specialization and going to move further. Hope I'll learn more interesting stuff!
