# *Hic sunt dracones*

Hello and welcome to my blog.

At the end of 2019 I dived into world of Data Science. Initially there was only intention to try some hype things. I selected most popular Data Science specialization on Coursera and started learning. [Here it is](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). It consists of nine courses and one capstone project. 

There is a funny moment, that 357,307 coursera users enrolled first course of specialization but only 10,079 users enrolled Capstone project. It is very dumb metric due to many reasons: one can enroll independent courses of interest as well as enroll all courses at once "for future use". But there is another metrics: number of ratings on each course and number of replies. I hope I can scientifically express my thougth after the Specialization being finished. Now I can only say that both of this two metrics fade from first course with 21,591 ratings and 4,320 reviews to capstone project with 935 ratings 249 reviews.

Is it the sign of badly designes specialization? Does it so boring and useless that peole just skip the courses? Or it is a common situation when very few reach the final course? I'm going to check the quality by my own. And imagine what if it would be OK! How wonderful it would be amongst those 3 or 6 percent! I hope I can do this. Going to report my progress in May.

My second insight I got from this post on David Robinson's blog: [Advice to aspirind data scientists: start the blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/). It is brilliant advice! Start your blog, state your presence in the world! This idea makes me mad. At the same time I registered my own domain and started working on my blog. With the help of this nice post on [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) I created the site and here is my first post on it! Hooray!

I've desided to take a dificult task and started blog in English. This is not my native language, so I'm sorry for all mistakes here. But I believe that doing things this way I can speak louder. Actually I can speak to the whole world. Amazing! Anyway it is good practice to express thougths and to formulate ideas in English. I'm not going to stick only to Data Science theme, so apparently there could be posts on any topic possible. I'm going to write a post once a week or two. Will see how it would we on practice!

Few words about title of my blog. Starting all of this I have made a step into *terra incognita*. I know nothing about modern ML, Data Science and so on. All I have is my knowledge of statistics from Univercity courses. I've never blogged before. I've never wrote in English on public. Medieval geographers put different labels on their maps to state the unknown land. One of this labels was *"[Hic sunt dracones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)"* or *"Here be dragons"*. It says like if you go there you could meet a dragon. *Hic sunt dracones*. This is the place where I am now.
